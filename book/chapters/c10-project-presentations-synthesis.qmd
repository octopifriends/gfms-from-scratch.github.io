## Course Roadmap Mapping

This week’s work in the broader GFM plan.

| Week | Stage | Focus | You will build (geogfm) | Library tools | Outcome |
|------|-------|-------|--------------------------|---------------|---------|
| 10 | Stage 3: Apply & Deploy | Presentations & Synthesis | Project deliverables (no new `geogfm` code required) | — | Present MVP builds, analysis, transition plan |

### Weekly goals
- Synthesize architecture, training, and evaluation learnings
- Present MVP results and insights
- Outline next steps with Prithvi/scale-up

## Session Outline

- Concepts → Components mapping
  - Model architecture → `models/gfm_vit.py`
  - Pretraining objective → `models/gfm_mae.py` + `modules/losses/mae_loss.py`
  - Training loop → `training/{optimizer.py, loop.py}`
  - Evaluation → `evaluation/{visualization.py, metrics.py}`
  - Applied tasks → `tasks/{classification.py, segmentation.py}`
  - Inference → `inference/{sliding_window.py, tiling.py}`

- Deliverables checklist
  - Slides with pipeline diagram and key code references
  - Short demo: load a small batch, run MAE forward, show recon
  - One analysis figure (recon grid or PSNR curve)
  - What you would swap to scale (timm blocks, TorchGeo datasets, FlashAttention, HF hub)
