## Course Description

This accelerated, hands-on seminar provides practical skills for working with state-of-the-art geospatial foundation models. Students learn to access, process, and analyze satellite imagery using modern tools, apply foundation models to real-world problems, and implement independent projects in environmental monitoring and analysis.

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Access and process satellite imagery using STAC APIs and cloud platforms
- Apply preprocessing pipelines for multi-temporal remote sensing data
- Train custom CNN models for land cover classification and change detection
- Load and fine-tune pretrained geospatial foundation models
- Implement spatiotemporal analysis for environmental monitoring applications
- Design and execute independent research projects using geospatial AI

## Getting Started with the UCSB AI Sandbox

[Here](../installation/GRIT_SETUP.md) are detailed instructions for setting up the class environment on the UCSB AI Sandbox, including foundation model installation and GPU optimization. This should all be taken care of for the class, but could be helpful if you are interested in deploying our class infrastructure on a different server or a local machine.
