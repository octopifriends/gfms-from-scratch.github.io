## Final Project Results (Week 6)

**Student Name**: [Your Name]  
**Project Title**: [Your Project Title]  
**Presentation Date**: [Date]

### MVP Overview (1-2 minutes)

**Problem Recap** (30 seconds):
- [Brief reminder of the problem you're solving]

**Current Status** (1 minute):
- [What have you accomplished so far?]
- [What is working in your current implementation?]

### Technical Implementation (3-4 minutes)

**System Architecture**:
```
[Include a simple diagram or flowchart of your system]
Data Input → Preprocessing → Model → Post-processing → Output
```

**Key Components Implemented**:
- [x] Data loading and preprocessing pipeline
- [x] Model setup and configuration  
- [x] Basic training/fine-tuning workflow
- [ ] Advanced evaluation metrics
- [ ] Visualization dashboard
- [ ] Scalable deployment

**Technology Stack**:
- **Data Processing**: [e.g., Earth Engine, rasterio, xarray]
- **Model Framework**: [e.g., PyTorch, TorchGeo, HuggingFace]
- **Visualization**: [e.g., Matplotlib, Folium, Plotly]
- **Infrastructure**: [e.g., UCSB AI Sandbox, local development]

### Live Demonstration (4-5 minutes)

**Demo Script** (prepare talking points for each step):

1. **Data Loading Demo** (1 minute):
   - [Show loading and preprocessing of your specific dataset]
   - [Highlight any data challenges you've solved]

2. **Model Inference Demo** (2 minutes):
   - [Run your model on sample data]
   - [Show inputs and outputs clearly]

3. **Results Visualization** (1-2 minutes):
   - [Display results in an intuitive format]
   - [Compare with baselines or ground truth if available]

### Preliminary Results (2-3 minutes)

**Quantitative Results**:
- **Dataset Size**: [Number of samples, spatial/temporal coverage]
- **Model Performance**: [Key metrics with numbers]
- **Processing Time**: [Inference speed, training time]

**Example Results Table**:
| Metric | Baseline | Your Model | Notes |
|--------|----------|------------|-------|
| Accuracy | XX% | YY% | [Context] |
| F1-Score | XX | YY | [Context] |
| Processing Speed | XX sec | YY sec | [Context] |

**Qualitative Observations**:
- [What patterns or insights have you discovered?]
- [What works well? What doesn't work as expected?]

### Challenges and Solutions (2 minutes)

**Technical Challenges Overcome**:
1. **Challenge**: [Specific technical problem]
   **Solution**: [How you solved it]

2. **Challenge**: [Another problem]
   **Solution**: [Your approach]

**Current Limitations**:
- [What are the current limitations of your system?]
- [What assumptions are you making?]

### Future Work and Extensions (1-2 minutes)

**Potential Improvements**:
- [ ] [How could this work be extended beyond the course?]
- [ ] [Additional datasets or geographic regions]
- [ ] [Advanced modeling techniques or optimizations]

**Real-World Applications**:
- [How could this work be used in practice?]
- [What are the broader implications and potential impact?]

**Next Steps for Deployment**:
- [What would be needed to make this production-ready?]

### Questions for Feedback (1 minute)

**Specific Areas Where You'd Like Input**:
1. [Technical question about approach or implementation]
2. [Question about evaluation methodology]  
3. [Question about scope or next steps]

**Open Discussion**:
- [Any other areas where peer feedback would be valuable]
