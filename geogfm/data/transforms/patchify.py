) -> Array:
    """
    Reassemble a (bands, H, W) image from non-overlapping square patches.

    Parameters
    ----------
    patches : Array
        Patches in row-major scan order with shape (N, bands, patch_size, patch_size),
        where N must equal (height // patch_size) * (width // patch_size).
    height : int
        Target image height in pixels.
    width : int
        Target image width in pixels.
    patch_size : int
        Size of each square patch in pixels. Assumes stride == patch_size (no overlap).

    Returns
    -------
    Array
        Reconstructed image of shape (bands, height, width).

    Notes
    -----
    - Assumes patches are laid out left-to-right, top-to-bottom (row-major).
    - Ignores any remainder if `height` or `width` is not divisible by `patch_size`
      (i.e., only the `grid_h * patch_size` by `grid_w * patch_size` area is filled).
    - No blending is performed (because there is no overlap).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Suppose height=width=64, patch_size=32, bands=13
    >>> # patches.shape == (4, 13, 32, 32), ordered row-major
    >>> img = reconstruct_from_patches(patches, 64, 64, 32)
