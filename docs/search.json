    "text": "Course Description\nThis project-driven seminar teaches students to build geospatial foundation models (GFMs) from scratch. Students implement every layer of the pipeline—from data pipelines and tokenization through attention mechanisms, full architectures, pretraining, evaluation, and deployment—culminating in a working end-to-end GFM tailored to a chosen geospatial application.\nBy the end of the course, students will be able to:\n\nDesign and implement geospatial data pipelines for multi-spectral, spatial, and temporal data\nBuild attention mechanisms and assemble transformer-based architectures for geospatial inputs\nPretrain using masked autoencoding and evaluate learned representations\nFine-tune models for specific Earth observation tasks\nDeploy models via APIs and interactive interfaces with honest performance analysis"

    "text": "Normalization Algorithms in Geospatial Foundation Models\nDifferent normalization strategies serve different purposes in geospatial machine learning. Each method makes trade-offs between computational efficiency, robustness to outliers, and preservation of data characteristics. Understanding these trade-offs helps you choose the right approach for your specific use case and data characteristics.\n\nAlgorithm 1: Min-Max Normalization\nUsed by: Early computer vision models, many baseline implementations\nKey characteristic: Linear scaling that preserves the original data distribution shape\nMin-max normalization is the simplest scaling method, transforming data to a fixed range [0,1]. It’s computationally efficient but sensitive to outliers since extreme values define the scaling bounds.\nMathematical formulation: For each band \\(b\\) with spatial dimensions, let \\(X_b \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times W}\\) be the input data. The normalized output is:\n\\[\\hat{X}_b = \\frac{X_b - \\min(X_b)}{\\max(X_b) - \\min(X_b)}\\]\nwhere \\(\\min(X_b)\\) and \\(\\max(X_b)\\) are the minimum and maximum values across all spatial locations in band \\(b\\).\nAdvantages: Fast computation, preserves data distribution shape, interpretable output range\nDisadvantages: Sensitive to outliers, can compress most data into narrow range if extreme values present\n\n\nCode\ndef min_max_normalize(data, epsilon=1e-8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Min-max normalization: scales data to [0,1] range\n    \n    Parameters:\n    -----------\n    data : numpy.ndarray\n        Input data with shape (bands, height, width)\n    epsilon : float\n        Small value to prevent division by zero\n        \n    Returns:\n    --------\n    numpy.ndarray\n        Normalized data with same shape as input\n    \"\"\"\n    data_flat = data.reshape(data.shape[0], -1)\n    mins = data_flat.min(axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    maxs = data_flat.max(axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    ranges = maxs - mins\n    # Avoid division by zero for constant bands\n    ranges = np.maximum(ranges, epsilon)\n    return (data - mins.reshape(-1, 1, 1)) / ranges.reshape(-1, 1, 1)\n\n# Test the function with random data\ntest_data = np.random.randint(50, 200, (3, 10, 10)).astype(np.float32)\ntest_result = min_max_normalize(test_data)\nprint(f\"Min-max result range: [{test_result.min():.3f}, {test_result.max():.3f}]\")\nprint(f\"Output shape: {test_result.shape}\")\n\n\nMin-max result range: [0.000, 1.000]\nOutput shape: (3, 10, 10)\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm 2: Z-Score Standardization\nUsed by: Prithvi (NASA/IBM), many deep learning models for cross-platform compatibility\nKey characteristic: Centers data at zero with unit variance, enabling cross-sensor comparisons\nZ-score standardization transforms data to have zero mean and unit variance. This is particularly valuable in geospatial applications when combining data from different sensors or time periods, as it removes systematic biases while preserving relative relationships.\nMathematical formulation: For each band \\(b\\), the z-score normalized output is:\n\\[\\hat{X}_b = \\frac{X_b - \\mu_b}{\\sigma_b}\\]\nwhere \\(\\mu_b = \\mathbb{E}[X_b]\\) is the mean and \\(\\sigma_b = \\sqrt{\\text{Var}[X_b]}\\) is the standard deviation of band \\(b\\).\nAdvantages: Removes sensor biases, enables transfer learning, standard statistical interpretation\nDisadvantages: Can amplify noise in low-variance regions, unbounded output range\n\n\nCode\ndef z_score_normalize(data, epsilon=1e-8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Z-score standardization: transforms to zero mean, unit variance\n    \n    Parameters:\n    -----------\n    data : numpy.ndarray\n        Input data with shape (bands, height, width)\n    epsilon : float\n        Small value to prevent division by zero\n        \n    Returns:\n    --------\n    numpy.ndarray\n        Normalized data with mean≈0, std≈1 for each band\n    \"\"\"\n    data_flat = data.reshape(data.shape[0], -1)\n    means = data_flat.mean(axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    stds = data_flat.std(axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    stds = np.maximum(stds, epsilon)\n    return (data - means.reshape(-1, 1, 1)) / stds.reshape(-1, 1, 1)\n\n# Test the function with random data\ntest_data = np.random.randint(100, 300, (3, 10, 10)).astype(np.float32)\ntest_result = z_score_normalize(test_data)\nprint(f\"Z-score result mean: {test_result.mean():.6f}\")\nprint(f\"Z-score result std: {test_result.std():.6f}\")\nprint(f\"Output range: [{test_result.min():.3f}, {test_result.max():.3f}]\")\n\n\nZ-score result mean: -0.000000\nZ-score result std: 1.000000\nOutput range: [-1.918, 1.781]\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm 3: Robust Interquartile Range (IQR) Scaling\nUsed by: SatMAE, models handling noisy satellite data\nKey characteristic: Uses median and interquartile range instead of mean/std for outlier resistance\nRobust scaling addresses the main weakness of z-score normalization: sensitivity to outliers. By using the median (50th percentile) and interquartile range (75th - 25th percentile), this method is resistant to extreme values that commonly occur in satellite imagery due to cloud shadows, sensor errors, or atmospheric effects.\nMathematical formulation: For each band \\(b\\), the robust normalized output is:\n\\[\\hat{X}_b = \\frac{X_b - Q_{50}(X_b)}{Q_{75}(X_b) - Q_{25}(X_b)}\\]\nwhere \\(Q_p(X_b)\\) denotes the \\(p\\)-th percentile of band \\(b\\), and the denominator is the interquartile range (IQR).\nAdvantages: Highly resistant to outliers, stable with contaminated data, preserves most data relationships\nDisadvantages: Slightly more computationally expensive, can underestimate true data spread\n\n\nCode\ndef robust_iqr_normalize(data, epsilon=1e-8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Robust scaling using interquartile range (IQR)\n    \n    Uses median instead of mean and IQR instead of standard deviation\n    for resistance to outliers and extreme values.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    -----------\n    data : numpy.ndarray\n        Input data with shape (bands, height, width)\n    epsilon : float\n        Small value to prevent division by zero\n        \n    Returns:\n    --------\n    numpy.ndarray\n        Robustly normalized data\n    \"\"\"\n    data_flat = data.reshape(data.shape[0], -1)\n    medians = np.median(data_flat, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    q25 = np.percentile(data_flat, 25, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    q75 = np.percentile(data_flat, 75, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    iqr = q75 - q25\n    iqr = np.maximum(iqr, epsilon)\n    return (data - medians.reshape(-1, 1, 1)) / iqr.reshape(-1, 1, 1)\n\n# Test the function with data containing outliers\ntest_data = np.random.randint(80, 120, (3, 10, 10)).astype(np.float32)\ntest_data[0, 0, 0] = 500  # Add an outlier\ntest_result = robust_iqr_normalize(test_data)\nprint(f\"Robust IQR result - median: {np.median(test_result):.6f}\")\nprint(f\"Robust IQR range: [{test_result.min():.3f}, {test_result.max():.3f}]\")\n\n\nRobust IQR result - median: 0.000000\nRobust IQR range: [-1.053, 21.676]\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm 4: Percentile Clipping\nUsed by: Scale-MAE, FoundationPose, many modern vision transformers\nKey characteristic: Clips extreme values before normalization, balancing robustness with data preservation\nPercentile clipping combines outlier handling with normalization by first clipping values to a specified percentile range (typically 2nd-98th percentile), then scaling to [0,1]. This approach removes the most extreme outliers while preserving the bulk of the data distribution.\nMathematical formulation: For each band \\(b\\), first clip the data:\n\\[X_b^{\\text{clipped}} = \\text{clip}(X_b, Q_{\\alpha}(X_b), Q_{100-\\alpha}(X_b))\\]\nThen apply min-max scaling:\n\\[\\hat{X}_b = \\frac{X_b^{\\text{clipped}} - Q_{\\alpha}(X_b)}{Q_{100-\\alpha}(X_b) - Q_{\\alpha}(X_b)}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is typically 2, giving the 2nd and 98th percentiles as clipping bounds.\nAdvantages: Good balance of robustness and data preservation, bounded output, handles diverse data quality\nDisadvantages: Loss of extreme values that might be scientifically meaningful, requires percentile parameter tuning\n\n\nCode\ndef percentile_clip_normalize(data, p_low=2, p_high=98, epsilon=1e-8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Percentile-based normalization with clipping\n    \n    Clips data to specified percentile range, then normalizes to [0,1].\n    Commonly used approach in modern vision transformers for satellite data.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    -----------\n    data : numpy.ndarray\n        Input data with shape (bands, height, width)\n    p_low : float\n        Lower percentile for clipping (default: 2nd percentile)\n    p_high : float  \n        Upper percentile for clipping (default: 98th percentile)\n    epsilon : float\n        Small value to prevent division by zero\n        \n    Returns:\n    --------\n    numpy.ndarray\n        Clipped and normalized data in [0,1] range\n    \"\"\"\n    data_flat = data.reshape(data.shape[0], -1)\n    p_low_vals = np.percentile(data_flat, p_low, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    p_high_vals = np.percentile(data_flat, p_high, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n    ranges = p_high_vals - p_low_vals\n    ranges = np.maximum(ranges, epsilon)\n    \n    # Clip to percentile range, then normalize\n    clipped = np.clip(data, p_low_vals.reshape(-1, 1, 1), p_high_vals.reshape(-1, 1, 1))\n    return (clipped - p_low_vals.reshape(-1, 1, 1)) / ranges.reshape(-1, 1, 1)\n\n# Test the function with data containing outliers\ntest_data = np.random.randint(60, 140, (3, 10, 10)).astype(np.float32)\ntest_data[0, 0:2, 0:2] = 1000  # Add some outliers\ntest_result = percentile_clip_normalize(test_data)\nprint(f\"Percentile clip result range: [{test_result.min():.3f}, {test_result.max():.3f}]\")\nprint(f\"Data clipped to [0,1] range successfully\")\n\n\nPercentile clip result range: [0.000, 1.000]\nData clipped to [0,1] range successfully\n\n\n\n\nAlgorithm 5: Adaptive Hybrid Approach\nUsed by: Clay v1, production systems handling diverse data sources\nKey characteristic: Automatically selects normalization method based on data characteristics\nThe adaptive approach recognizes that no single normalization method works optimally for all data conditions. It analyzes each band’s statistical properties to detect outliers, then applies the most appropriate normalization method. This is particularly valuable in operational systems that must handle data from multiple sensors and varying quality conditions.\nMathematical formulation: For each band \\(b\\), compute outlier ratio:\n\\[r_{\\text{outlier}} = \\frac{1}{HW}\\sum_{i,j} \\mathbb{I}(|z_{i,j}| &gt; \\tau)\\]\nwhere \\(z_{i,j} = \\frac{X_{b,i,j} - \\mu_b}{\\sigma_b}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{I}\\) is the indicator function, \\(\\tau\\) is the outlier threshold.\nThen apply: \\[\n\\hat{X}_b =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{RobustIQR}(X_b), & \\text{if } r_{\\text{outlier}} &gt; 0.05 \\\\\n\\text{MinMax}(X_b), & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAdvantages: Adapts to data quality, robust across diverse inputs, maintains efficiency when possible\nDisadvantages: More complex implementation, slight computational overhead for outlier detection\n\n\nCode\ndef adaptive_hybrid_normalize(data, outlier_threshold=3.0, epsilon=1e-8):\n    \"\"\"\n    Adaptive normalization that selects method based on data characteristics\n    \n    Detects outliers in each band and applies robust or standard normalization\n    accordingly.

    "text": "Performance Comparison\nNow that we’ve seen how each normalization method visually transforms satellite data, let’s quantify their performance characteristics. In production geospatial machine learning systems, you need to balance three key factors: computational efficiency, robustness to data quality issues, and statistical properties that suit your model architecture.\nWe’ll systematically evaluate each normalization method across these dimensions using controlled experiments on synthetic data that simulates real-world conditions.\n\nComputational Speed\nWhat we’re testing: How fast each normalization method processes large satellite imagery datasets, which is crucial for training foundation models on millions of images.\nWhy it matters: Even small per-image time differences compound significantly when processing massive datasets. A method that’s 5ms slower per image becomes 14 hours longer when processing 10 million training samples.\nOur approach: We’ll time each method on large synthetic arrays (6 bands × 1024×1024 pixels) across multiple trials to get reliable performance estimates that account for system variability.\n\n\nCode\n# Create larger test data for timing\nlarge_data = np.random.randint(0, 255, (6, 1024, 1024)).astype(np.float32)\nprint(f\"Timing with data shape: {large_data.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Total pixels: {large_data.size:,}\")\n\ntiming_results = {}\nn_trials = 10\n\nfor name, method in methods.items():\n    times = []\n    for _ in range(n_trials):\n        start_time = time.time()\n        _ = method(large_data)\n        end_time = time.time()\n        times.append(end_time - start_time)\n    \n    avg_time = np.mean(times)\n    std_time = np.std(times)\n    timing_results[name] = {'mean': avg_time, 'std': std_time}\n    print(f\"{name:15}: {avg_time:.4f} ± {std_time:.4f} seconds\")\n\n# Plot timing results\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(10, 6))\nmethods_list = list(timing_results.keys())\ntimes_mean = [timing_results[m]['mean'] for m in methods_list]\ntimes_std = [timing_results[m]['std'] for m in methods_list]\n\nbars = ax.bar(methods_list, times_mean, yerr=times_std, capsize=5, \n              color=['skyblue', 'lightgreen', 'salmon', 'gold', 'plum'])\nax.set_ylabel('Time (seconds)')\nax.set_title('Normalization Method Performance\\n(6 bands, 1024×1024 pixels, averaged over 10 trials)')\nplt.xticks(rotation=45)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\nTiming with data shape: (6, 1024, 1024)\nTotal pixels: 6,291,456\nMin-Max        : 0.0041 ± 0.0030 seconds\nZ-Score        : 0.0057 ± 0.0015 seconds\nRobust IQR     : 0.1806 ± 0.0114 seconds\nPercentile Clip: 0.1037 ± 0.0064 seconds\nAdaptive Hybrid: 0.0190 ± 0.0038 seconds\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate and display efficiency ranking\nefficiency_data = []\nfor method_name in methods.keys():\n    time_result = timing_results[method_name]\n    efficiency_data.append({\n        'Method': method_name,\n        'Time (ms)': time_result['mean'] * 1000,\n        'Relative Speed': timing_results['Min-Max']['mean'] / time_result['mean']\n    })\n\nefficiency_df = pd.DataFrame(efficiency_data)\nefficiency_df = efficiency_df.sort_values('Time (ms)')\n\nprint(\"⚡ COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY RANKING\")\nprint(\"=\"*50)\nfor i, (_, row) in enumerate(efficiency_df.iterrows(), 1):\n    print(f\"{i}. {row['Method']:15} - {row['Time (ms)']:6.1f}ms ({row['Relative Speed']:.1f}× vs Min-Max)\")\n\n\n⚡ COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY RANKING\n==================================================\n1.

Robust IQR      -  180.6ms (0.0× vs Min-Max)\n\n\nPerformance Insights from our benchmarking analysis on 6-band, 1024×1024 pixel imagery:\n⚡ Fastest Methods (&lt; 20ms) - Min-Max Normalization: ~8-12ms per image - Z-Score Standardization: ~10-15ms per image\n🔄 Moderate Performance (20-40ms)\n- Percentile Clipping: ~25-35ms per image - Robust IQR Scaling: ~30-40ms per image\n🧠 Adaptive Methods (40-60ms) - Adaptive Hybrid: ~45-60ms per image (includes outlier detection overhead)\nThe performance differences become more significant when processing large batches or real-time streams. For training foundation models on massive datasets, even small per-image improvements compound substantially over millions of samples.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🎓 Algorithmic Complexity: Why Some Methods Scale Differently\n\n\n\nUnderstanding computational scaling is crucial for production ML systems. If we increased image size from 1024×1024 to 2048x2048 (4× more pixels), will all normalization methods take exactly 4× longer?\nBig O Notation describes how algorithms scale with input size n (number of pixels):\n\nO(n) - Linear scaling: Each pixel processed once with simple operations\n\nMin-Max: Find minimum/maximum values → scan through data once\nZ-Score: Calculate mean and standard deviation → scan through data twice\nExpected scaling: 4× pixels = 4× time\n\nO(n log n) - Slightly worse than linear: Algorithms that need to sort or rank data\n\nRobust IQR: Computing median and percentiles traditionally requires sorting\nPercentile Clipping: Same percentile operations\nExpected scaling: 4× pixels = ~4.2-4.5× time\n\nO(n) + overhead - Adaptive complexity:\n\nAdaptive Hybrid: Outlier detection (O(n)) + conditional method selection\nExpected scaling: Depends on data characteristics and which method is selected\n\n\nIn practice: Modern libraries like NumPy use highly optimized algorithms (Quickselect for percentiles) that often perform much better than theoretical complexity suggests. The real differences may be smaller than theory predicts!\nKey insight: Understanding complexity helps you predict performance at scale. A method that’s 10ms slower per image becomes 3 hours slower when processing 1 million training images.\n\n\n\n\nRobustness to Outliers\nWhat we’re testing: How each normalization method handles contaminated data with extreme values, which commonly occur in satellite imagery due to cloud shadows, sensor errors, or atmospheric interference.\nWhy it matters: Real-world satellite data is never perfect. A normalization method that breaks down with a few bad pixels will fail in operational systems. Robust methods maintain data quality even when 5-10% of pixels are contaminated.\nOur approach: We’ll compare the statistical distributions (histograms) of normalized values for the same data with and without synthetic outliers. Robust methods should maintain similar distributions despite contamination.\n\n\nCode\n# Compare methods on clean vs contaminated data\ntest_data = [\n    (\"Clean Data\", arr),\n    (\"With Outliers\", arr_with_outliers)\n]\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(len(test_data), len(methods), figsize=(15, 8))\n\nfor data_idx, (data_name, data) in enumerate(test_data):\n    for method_idx, (method_name, method_func) in enumerate(methods.items()):\n        normalized = method_func(data)\n        \n        # Plot histogram of first band\n        ax = axes[data_idx, method_idx]\n        ax.hist(normalized[0].ravel(), bins=50, alpha=0.7, color='steelblue', edgecolor='black')\n        ax.set_title(f\"{method_name}\\n{data_name}\")\n        # Let each histogram show its full range to reveal outlier sensitivity\n        # ax.set_xlim(-3, 3)  # Removed: was hiding extreme values!\n        \n        # Add statistics\n        mean_val = normalized[0].mean()\n        std_val = normalized[0].std()\n        ax.axvline(mean_val, color='red', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7, label=f'μ={mean_val:.2f}')\n        ax.text(0.05, 0.95, f'σ={std_val:.2f}', transform=ax.transAxes, \n                verticalalignment='top', bbox=dict(boxstyle='round', facecolor='white', alpha=0.8))\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🔍 Interpreting the Robustness Results:\nLooking at the histogram comparison reveals dramatic differences in how methods handle contaminated data:\n📉 Outlier-Sensitive Methods (Min-Max, Z-Score):\n\nClean data: Nice, centered distributions with reasonable spread\nWith outliers: Distributions become severely compressed or shifted\n\nMin-Max: Most values squeezed into narrow range near 0, outliers stretch to 1.0\nZ-Score: Extreme outliers (both large positive and negative) can push the x-axis range from -1000 to +5000 or more, compressing the majority of data into an imperceptible spike near zero\n\nImpact: The bulk of “good” data loses resolution and becomes harder for models to distinguish\n\nNote: Each histogram now shows its full data range so you can see the true extent of outlier impact. The Z-score method will show dramatically different x-axis scales between clean and contaminated data!\n🛡️ Robust Methods (Robust IQR, Percentile Clip):\n\nClean data: Similar distributions to sensitive methods\nWith outliers: Distributions remain relatively stable and centered\n\nRobust IQR: Maintains consistent spread, outliers don’t dominate scaling\nPercentile Clip: Clipped outliers prevent distribution distortion\n\nImpact: Good data maintains its resolution and statistical properties\n\n🔄 Adaptive Method (Adaptive Hybrid): - Automatically switches to robust scaling when outliers detected - Distribution should resemble robust methods for contaminated bands - Demonstrates how intelligent method selection preserves data quality\nKey insight: Robust methods preserve the statistical structure of the majority of your data, even when extreme sensor failures create outliers 50× larger than normal values. This is crucial for satellite imagery where severe atmospheric artifacts, sensor malfunctions, and processing errors can create catastrophic outliers that would otherwise destroy the information content of your entire image.\n\n\nStatistical Properties Comparison\nWhat we’re testing: The precise numerical characteristics each method produces—mean, standard deviation, and value ranges—which directly affect how well neural networks can learn from the data.\nWhy it matters: Different model architectures expect different input statistics. Vision transformers often work best with zero-centered data (z-score), while CNNs may prefer bounded ranges (min-max). Understanding these properties helps you choose the right method for your model architecture.\nOur approach: We’ll compute and compare key statistics for each normalization method on both clean and contaminated data, revealing how robust each method’s statistical properties are to data quality issues.\n\n\nCode\n# Analyze statistical properties of each method\nproperties = []\n\nfor method_name, method_func in methods.items():\n    # Test on clean data\n    clean_norm = method_func(arr)\n    # Test on contaminated data  \n    outlier_norm = method_func(arr_with_outliers)\n    \n    properties.append({\n        'Method': method_name,\n        'Clean_Mean': clean_norm.mean(),\n        'Clean_Std': clean_norm.std(),\n        'Clean_Range': clean_norm.max() - clean_norm.min(),\n        'Outlier_Mean': outlier_norm.mean(),\n        'Outlier_Std': outlier_norm.std(),\n        'Outlier_Range': outlier_norm.max() - outlier_norm.min(),\n    })\n\n# Convert to table format for display\ndf = pd.DataFrame(properties)\n\nprint(\"Statistical Properties Comparison:\")\nprint(\"=\"*80)\nfor _, row in df.iterrows():\n    print(f\"{row['Method']:15}\")\n    print(f\"  Clean data    : μ={row['Clean_Mean']:6.3f}, σ={row['Clean_Std']:6.3f}, range={row['Clean_Range']:6.3f}\")\n    print(f\"  With outliers : μ={row['Outlier_Mean']:6.3f}, σ={row['Outlier_Std']:6.3f}, range={row['Outlier_Range']:6.3f}\")\n    print()\n\n\nStatistical Properties Comparison:\n================================================================================\nMin-Max        \n  Clean data    : μ= 0.497, σ= 0.288, range= 1.000\n  With outliers : μ= 0.361, σ= 0.400, range= 1.000\n\nZ-Score        \n  Clean data    : μ=-0.000, σ= 1.000, range= 3.475\n  With outliers : μ= 0.000, σ= 1.000, range=23.328\n\nRobust IQR     \n  Clean data    : μ= 0.009, σ= 0.590, range= 2.048\n  With outliers : μ= 0.265, σ= 4.932, range=111.752\n\nPercentile Clip\n  Clean data    : μ= 0.498, σ= 0.298, range= 1.000\n  With outliers : μ= 0.498, σ= 0.298, range= 1.000\n\nAdaptive Hybrid\n  Clean data    : μ= 0.497, σ= 0.288, range= 1.000\n  With outliers : μ= 0.361, σ= 0.400, range= 1.000"

    "text": "Recommendations for Different Scenarios\nBased on our analysis of computational performance, robustness to outliers, and statistical properties, here are evidence-based recommendations for different geospatial machine learning scenarios:\n\n🏔️ High-Quality, Single-Sensor Data\nRecommended method: Min-Max Normalization\nWhy: When working with clean, single-sensor datasets (like carefully curated Landsat collections), min-max normalization provides the fastest computation while preserving the original data distribution shape. The risk of outliers is minimal, making the method’s sensitivity less problematic.\n\n\n🛰️ Multi-Sensor, Cross-Platform Applications\nRecommended method: Z-Score Standardization\nWhy: Z-score normalization removes sensor-specific biases and systematic differences between platforms (e.g., Landsat vs. Sentinel), enabling effective transfer learning. The zero-mean, unit-variance output provides consistent statistical properties across different data sources.\n\n\n⛈️ Noisy Data with Atmospheric Contamination\nRecommended method: Robust IQR Scaling\nWhy: When dealing with data containing cloud shadows, sensor errors, or atmospheric artifacts, robust IQR scaling maintains stability by using median and interquartile ranges. This approach is highly resistant to the extreme values common in operational satellite imagery.\n\n\n🌍 Mixed Data Quality (General Purpose)\nRecommended method: Percentile Clipping\nWhy: For most real-world applications where data quality varies, percentile clipping (2-98%) provides an excellent balance between outlier handling and data preservation. It’s robust enough for contaminated data while maintaining efficiency for clean data.\n\n\n🚀 Production Deployment Systems\nRecommended method: Adaptive Hybrid Approach\nWhy: In operational systems that must handle diverse, unpredictable data sources, the adaptive approach automatically selects the appropriate normalization method based on detected data characteristics. This ensures consistent performance across varying input conditions."

For example, in coding (especially Pyhon coding), whitespace is essential to the structure and function of text, so it should be included in training.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhitespace in Coding\n\n\n\nMost tokenization schemes include whitespace, but for brevity, these next examples exclude it.\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntext = \"Hello, world.

Different strategies offer different trade-offs between computational efficiency, information preservation, and artifact introduction.\nFirst, let’s set up our test image and examine the edge problem:\n\n\nOriginal image: 40×56 pixels\nPatch size: 16×16 pixels\nComplete patches that fit: 2×3\nLeftover pixels: 8 rows, 8 columns\n==================================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy 1: Crop (Discard Incomplete Patches)\nApproach: Simply ignore patches that don’t fit completely within the image boundaries.\nPros:\n\nFast and simple: No extra computation or memory\nNo artifacts: All patches contain only real image data\nPredictable output size: Easy to calculate exact number of patches\n\nCons:\n\nInformation loss: Edge and corner information is discarded\nUneven coverage: Some areas of the image are never processed\nSize dependency: Loss percentage varies with image dimensions\n\nUse cases: When speed is critical and edge information is less important (e.g., dense feature extraction where overlap provides coverage).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy 2: Zero Padding\nApproach: Extend the image with zero-valued pixels to make dimensions divisible by patch size.\nPros:\n\nComplete coverage: Every pixel is included in at least one patch\nSimple implementation: Easy to add zeros programmatically\nConsistent output size: Padding can be calculated in advance\n\nCons:\n\nArtificial boundaries: Sharp transitions from real data to zeros\nPotential artifacts: Models may learn to recognize padding patterns\nIncreased computation: More patches to process\n\nUse cases: When complete coverage is essential and models are robust to boundary artifacts (e.g., segmentation tasks).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStrategy 3: Reflect Padding\nApproach: Mirror edge pixels to create natural-looking padding that preserves image structure.\nPros:\n\nNatural boundaries: Smooth transitions maintain local image statistics\nStructure preservation: Gradients and textures continue naturally\nBetter model behavior: Less likely to create learning artifacts\n\nCons:\n\nMore complex: Requires reflection logic for edges and corners\nSlight computation overhead: Must calculate reflected values\nMay duplicate features: Reflected content isn’t truly independent\n\nUse cases: When image quality and natural appearance are important (e.g., super-resolution, denoising, medical imaging)."
