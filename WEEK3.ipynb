    "NOTES\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1\n",
    "- eurosat gives knowledge to go acess the data, not actual data\n",
    "- repo already organized into test, train, calidate\n",
    "- \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2\n",
    "- each image has a label, labels note embedded in the image\n",
    "- grab random images til one of every label\n",
    "- need to do visualization normalization, trained on normalized data Pirthve\n",
    "- numbers 0 to 4000 need to remap from 0 to 1 ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3\n",
    " - grab same bands , normalize band statistics over the dataset not the image level\n",
    " - YOU want to use approaches to use (Normalize band statistics over the dataset!)\n",
    " - Build transofmmms -- object past to the model gives the model the abilirt to do transformations, need to be functions\n",
    " - transformed datasets not have ability to do band selection and image thing\n",
    " - transofrm as go unless using them all every time. Transofrms is second copy of the image can be heavy memory \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4\n",
    "- how we are optimizing them to load in\n",
    "- ways to parallelize them\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 5 \n",
    "- factory is a algorthimc way of generating objects\n",
    "- encoder decoder favroty way of making models,\n",
    "- CHECK OUT TASK IN DOCUMENTATION\n",
    "- MIGHT change based on task for the build model\n",
    "- move model onto the GPU\n",
    "- lightning a cool new way to do this! but for now this\n",
    "- freeze backbone or not -- frozen becomes much less parameters only decoder\n",
    "- model on device -- can train model on normal cpu but will take forever, so need matrice multiplications to happen in parallel, can do that with graphics cards!\n",
    "- turn graphics card into general langauge computer\n",
    "-  graphics cards that run cuda!!! is running that language want to be navidai cuda \n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3 Zero-shot evaluation\n",
    "- take model and run inference on model images\n",
    "- wont work cause not giving labels and wasnt yet trained to distinguish between classes\n",
    "- no fine tuning or context just gave sealake\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 4 \n",
    "- give small set of images all happen to be the same class level 1. Will create a set of output that have some pattern that locates them in hyperdimensional space\n",
    "- NOT decoder if fewshot just in model hyperdimensional space\n",
    "- work well in classes look similar, work worse in\n",
    "- save encoding dimensions and give it to whichever one is closest. Nearest neighbor things\n",
    "- pull 5 random images from each class pass through model and save the average of where they were as the cluster centroids\n",
    "- NORMALLY do better at 70% the few shot, not as bad\n",
    "- just passed one image through this test so didnt actually learn a lot in this example, would want to alter this code to use more images \n",
    "\n",
    "Step 6A\n",
    "- decoder head training with a few examples\n",
    "- still few shot but only a little traing on the decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "NEED NEW THINGS\n",
    "- LOSS FUNCTION - how far away we are from what we want\n",
    "- OPTIMIZER method for updating parameters within the model\n",
    "- CAN have different optimizer for different tasks\n",
    "- learning rate, should not move very far because dont want to take big steps (trade off how fast learning rate it\n",
    "\n",
    "validation loop same but not any updates\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "def train_model( tells you how many epochs you want to do loop the loop!\n",
    "\n"
